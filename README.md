# -Autowired-in-Spring
In Spring, @Autowired is an annotation used for automatic dependency injection. It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into your bean. When you annotate a field, setter method, or constructor with @Autowired, Spring's dependency injection mechanism will automatically inject the appropriate bean based on the type.
